## Project structure
Based on good practices : 

## My General Approach:
 - Start with best practices, such as [Node Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) and [React Best Practices](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/20-github-repositories-to-become-a-react-master-%EF%B8%8F-b91fb3bdd6c8), [This one](https://fireart.studio/blog/9-react-best-practices-to-improve-your-react-code/
).
 - Apply your previous experiences to make the project more efficient and maintainable for our specific case.
 - Periodically refactor it based on the requirements and simplicity concept and new experiences

## Core framework: React
 For me React, Angular and Vuejs are almost the sam. All based on Virtual DOM, with a modular model. The companies which I was recently worked with them were working with React because of its flexibility,  popularity, simplicity and power, or sometimes business force, so I've used React for this project as the easiest one for me.

## Styling framework
 Among my large-scale projects almost in each one the approach was different. Starting with pure CSS, I've utilized [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/), [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, Bootstrap. 
 I chose Sass with a simple implementation. Based on needs it can be more sophisticated and modularized. 

# Reactive and State management framework
 Used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as a simple, yet efficient, which helps medium and large-scale projects to manage the state. 


 ## Some rules
 - If your design would be just for one product / project, you can tailor the solution and be opinionated. But if the design is not for a single project, single team and single product, I prefer to use generic frameworks and best practices.
