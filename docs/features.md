    Here I chose poor scss to prevent over-engineering for this project. However I commonly use two frameworks for styling: `styled-components` and `tailwind`. I choose Tailwind because of it fast starting time and it's easy to use. In large scale project I prefer `styled-components` because of it's performance and it's easy to maintain.
